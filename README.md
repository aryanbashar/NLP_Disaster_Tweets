# NLP_Disaster_Tweets
This mini project will be a case study in Natural Language Processing through disaster tweets from Twitter. This will involve exploring a train and test dataset available on Kaggle, collected from Twitter, and contains the columns of id, text, location, keyword, and target (train set only). It includes 10,000 tweets that were hand classified. A machine learning model will be built and trained to predict which tweets are about real disasters and which are not. 

Natural Language Processing (NLP) can encompass many different techniques that can help machines learn from text. It has been used in search engines, chatbots, machine translation, and sentiment analysis. We will begin by loading in the data and explore the tweets.
